# GodSpeak-Twitter
The official GitHub repo of the Godspeak Twitter Bot

## How this works?
/vocab.txt is used as a datafile from where the contents are stored in a list, the [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) module is then used to generate content.\
The [TempleAPI](https://temple.xslendi.xyz/docs) made by [slendi](https://git.checksum.fail/slendi/TempleAPI) is used for the Terry Quotes feature. 
We will be using the [tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) Twitter API wrapper for [Python](https://www.python.org/), for the GodSpeak feature.
